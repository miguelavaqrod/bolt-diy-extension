A DIY blank bolt extension so you can later modify it to your needs

So I was unable to make locally installed extensions work, I just prepared this blank extension so later I can modify it to fit my needs.
Just install it the normal way in Bolt, and later modify the Extension.php to your needs, add assets folders, etc.
